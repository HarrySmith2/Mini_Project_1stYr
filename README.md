# Mini_Project_1stYr
Welcome.

This is a project designed by a group of first year, Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity students attending Coventry univeristy.

The aim of this project was to design and set up a wireless network that users will be allowed to connect to, 
after which a small amount of data collection on the user will occur.

We have desgined a very basic set of webpages that will copy the OUI of a MAC address aswell as an email.

We fell that this is simply proof of concept code, and it can be expanded upon to make it into a more 
mallicious and/or nefarious portable Wi-Fi network.

However, we do not want to be expelled from the University, so we may come back to this at a later date, to make it more potent.

The main write up documents are "ProjectIgnorance_HowTo" and ProjectIgnorance_WriteUp if you are interested.
